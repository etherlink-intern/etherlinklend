# Launch Checklist

Any unchecked launch-blocking item prevents mainnet deployment.

## Checklist Control

Use this file as the launch gate index. A checkbox can only move to done after
the owner has linked evidence in the evidence log and the required review gate
has passed.

Status terms:

- `TODO`: no merged evidence yet.
- `IN PROGRESS`: a PR or external review is active.
- `BLOCKED`: waiting on missing evidence, owner decision, external dependency,
  or failed validation.
- `DONE`: evidence is linked, reviewed, and merged.
- `N/A`: explicitly out of scope for the current launch, with rationale.

## Owner And Date Matrix

Dates are gate deadlines, not calendar promises. Replace role owners with named
owners before Shadownet deployment.

| Gate | Primary owner | Reviewers | Due gate | Required evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upstream and licensing | Release owner | Legal reviewer, protocol engineer | Before Shadownet deployment | Upstream SHA table, license review notes, NOTICE delta, fork policy review | TODO |
| Build and tests | Protocol engineer | Release owner | Every PR and before each deployment rehearsal | CI run, local command output where available, gas snapshot decision | TODO |
| Security review | Security reviewer | Protocol engineer, external auditor | Before mainnet approval | Static-analysis results, fork-diff report, finding tracker, audit package | TODO |
| Oracle readiness | Oracle reviewer | Risk owner, protocol engineer, monitoring owner | Before market approval | Feed proofs, decimals/freshness evidence, failure-mode tests, fallback decision | TODO |
| Market readiness | Risk owner | Oracle reviewer, security reviewer, operations lead | Before Shadownet market creation | Asset reviews, market config, LLTV/IRM/cap rationale, liquidation assumptions | TODO |
| Etherlink readiness | Operations lead | Deployment owner, monitoring owner | Before Shadownet deployment and again before mainnet | Chain/RPC/explorer proofs, failover plan, monitoring and bot readiness | TODO |
| Deployment readiness | Deployment owner | Release owner, security reviewer | Before each broadcast | Dry-run evidence, admin/multisig proof, artifact validation, final approval | TODO |
| Post-launch operations | Operations lead | Risk owner, monitoring owner | Before mainnet market visibility | Watch assignment, incident contacts, risk report cadence, public docs update | TODO |

## Evidence Log Format

Add evidence under the relevant checklist section or in a linked PR using this
format. Keep command output concise, but include enough detail for a reviewer to
reproduce the claim.

```text

Evidence source: <PR URL, commit SHA, CI run URL, doc path, artifact path, or external review link>
Validation: <commands run, CI jobs, on-chain calls, audit references, or manual review>

Decision: <accepted, rejected, needs follow-up, or N/A with rationale>
